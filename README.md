### Le Quset
A data abstraction layer over database clients.

##### The Problem
This library is going to focus on normalizing an interface between application code and database client code.  The hopes and intent of this library is to provibe developers a way to think about databases / persistence / logging / caching as essentially one layer.  External dependencies of our applications become one common interface.
